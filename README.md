# portfolio
## Description  This project is a build where I will create a portfolio of work that resembles the mock-up site provided in Gitlab. Everything will be from scratch from the HTML to the Advanced CSS so I have to use all of the tools and resources I've learned in these first two modules. 
## Installation  N/A    
## Usage  This website will showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a position.  
## Credits  N/A
