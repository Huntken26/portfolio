            <p class="paragraph"> Hello there, my name is Ken Hunter and I am a Web Developer from Chicago, Illinois.
                Ever since I was a child I was fascinated with tech. It began with computer
                games and eventually grew into developing web applications. In 2023 I graduated from a Coding bootcamp
                to gain skills as a Full Stack Developer. I was able to learn the basics of web development from HTML,
                CSS & Javascript to
                more specialized subjects such as API's,
                Node.js, Object Oriented Programming, SQL among other things. I was able to work on multiple solo and
                team
                projects.
                <br><br /> I am a huge fan of the agile mindset and I love a challenge. Take a peek into my github and
                you
                can see the professional projects I've completed as well
                as the personal passion projects I am currently developing. Thank you for taking the time to checkout my
                portfolio. I look forward to hearing from you soon!
            </p>
